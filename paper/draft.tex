\begin{abstract}
Accurate disease prediction is vital for timely intervention, 
effective treatment, and reducing medical complications. 
While symbolic AI has been applied in healthcare, 
its adoption remains limited due to the complexity 
of required knowledge bases.
This work introduces \sys, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) 
with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome this barrier. 
LLMs extract medical knowledge from text and translate it into ASP code, 
while ASP enables structured, explainable reasoning. 
This integration yields a robust, interpretable prediction framework 
that leverages the strengths of both paradigms. 
\sys shows strong performance on real patient data.
% \sys accurately predicts diseases based on symptoms derived from medical literature.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Getting an accurate diagnosis quickly can make all the difference in patient outcomes, 
but building automated systems that practitioners can actually trust is still a major challenge. 
Symbolic AI, and in particular Answer Set Programming (ASP), provides clear logical reasoning \cite{Brewka2011,Gelfond_Kahl_2014}. 
However, its adoption has been limited because constructing and maintaining large, 
domain-specific knowledge bases is very labor-intensive.
On the other hand, Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong results on tasks
such as medical question answering and clinical note summarization \cite{Singhal2022LargeLM,Singhal2023,Zheng2024LLMmed}, 
but their tendency to produce inconsistent or opaque outputs makes them risky for clinical use \cite{aljohani2025comprehensivesurveytrustworthinesslarge, rudin2019stopexplainingblackbox}.

In clinical decision support, the real goal is to get the best of both worlds: 
systems that reason accurately while still being easy for practitioners to trust and use. 
\sys takes a step in that direction by combining the strengths of LLMs and ASP. 
Instead of requiring experts to hand-craft large knowledge bases, 
\sys automatically converts medical literature into ASP rules. 
These rules are then enriched with patient symptoms and clinical indicators, 
and passed through an ASP solver to produce diagnostic suggestions together with logical justifications.
On public patient records, \sys reaches 95–100\% predictive accuracy on selected diseases, 
while giving transparent explanations for each diagnosis.

% Concretely, this work:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Introduces a framework that combines the flexibility of LLMs with the explanability of ASP for disease diagnosis.
%     \item Provides solver-based explanations showing how symptoms lead to rules and then to diagnoses.
%     \item Demonstrates accurate results on real patient data while keeping the reasoning fully transparent.
% \end{itemize}

The paper begins with background on LLMs and ASP (\cref{sec:background}), 
then details the \sys framework (\cref{sec:methodology}), 
evaluates the approach on patient data (\cref{sec:results}), 
and concludes with a discussion of limitations and future directions (\cref{sec:conclusion}).

\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

\paragraph{\textbf{Large Language Models}}
LLMs \cite{zhao2023survey} are advanced computational systems 
designed to understand and generate human language. 
Developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques, 
these models can produce text that closely mirrors human linguistic patterns.
Modern architectures such as \textit{GPT-5} \cite{openai2023gpt4, gpt5}, 
are trained on massive corpora spanning diverse domains, 
enabling them to acquire broad, cross-disciplinary knowledge. 
LLMs use deep learning algorithms \cite{Sarker2021} 
and specifically transformer networks \cite{Dosovitskiy2020} 
to analyze and understand the relationships between words, phrases, and sentences. 
By capturing patterns and structures in the training data, 
they can generate coherent and relevant responses based on given prompts.
The term “large” refers to the billions of parameters 
that allow these models to generate context-aware responses. 
The basic premise of an LLM is its ability to predict 
the next word (referred to as a token) based on the text it has observed so far, 
according to the context.

% The following examples illustrate how LLMs have supported various applications \cite{Paranjape2023}.

LLMs have demonstrated strong performance across a variety of natural language tasks, 
including question answering \cite{Brown2020}, summarization \cite{Zhang2020}, 
dialogue generation \cite{Thoppilan2022lamda}, and code synthesis \cite{Chen2021}. 
In specialized domains such as biomedicine, domain-adapted LLMs have been employed 
for clinical decision support \cite{Singhal2023} and 
biomedical knowledge retrieval \cite{Luo2022}.
Among their capabilities, LLMs excel at transforming text from one representation to another, 
making them powerful tools for a wide range of natural language processing tasks. 
This characteristic is particurarly relevant to the present work, 
which focuses on the effective encoding of medical literature. \\

\paragraph{\textbf{Challenges in applying LLMs}}

LLMs are not without errors \cite{Raj2023, Ruis2023}. 
They can occasionally produce incorrect or biased responses 
that reflect the biases inherent in the training data. 
There have been efforts to mitigate these issues 
through data preprocessing techniques and fine-tuning \cite{Dodge2021}.
Ongoing research seeks to improve the factual accuracy, safety, and interpretability 
of these models, enabling their deployment in high-stakes environments \cite{Ganguli2022}. \\

\paragraph{\textbf{Answer Set Programming}}

Answer Set Programming (ASP) \cite{Eiter2009} is a declarative problem-solving paradigm 
rooted in logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning \cite{Brewka2011}. 
The formal semantics of stable models and the foundational ASP language 
were first introduced by Gelfond and Lifschitz \cite{Gelfond2000, gel88}.
Programming with this approach is done in a family of languages 
sometimes referred to as \textit{AnsProlog} \cite{Gelfond2002}.

The central idea of ASP is to represent a problem 
declaratively using logical rules, facts, and constraints. 
These elements collectively form a program that describes the conditions any solution must satisfy. 
Instead of writing an algorithm to solve the problem, 
the programmer encodes the specification of valid solutions. 
An ASP solver then processes this program to compute one or more stable models (also known as answer sets),
each of which corresponds to a solution that satisfies all the given rules and constraints.

In traditional programming, transitioning from a problem to a solution 
requires the programmer's thorough understanding of the given problem, 
followed by the creation of a program that will produce the correct output 
when provided with an instance of the problem, which will then be interpreted as the solution. 
In ASP, the process of deriving solutions from a problem specification 
typically follows a sequence of well-defined steps \cite{Gebser2013}, 
as illustrated in \cref{fig:asp-solving}. 
First, the problem is modeled using the ASP language. 
Next, a grounder (e.g., gringo \cite{Gebser2014}) transforms the program into a set of basic rules and facts. 
Finally, a solver (e.g., clasp \cite{Holldobler2014}) computes the stable models (answer sets), 
which correspond to the solutions of the original problem.

\end{tikzpicture}

    \label{fig:asp-solving}
\end{figure}

Several solvers for ASP have been developed, such as DLV \cite{Xia2020}. 
This work uses the ASP system clingo, 
which integrates the gringo grounder \cite{Gebser2014} with the clasp solver \cite{Holldobler2014} into a single system. 
Clingo also offers a powerful Python API, enabling the solver's integration into other applications.

\section{Related work}
\paragraph{\textbf{ASP for disease diagnosis}}
ASP has been used to represent and reason over medical knowledge in a declarative, logic-based manner. 
Early work applied ASP to biomedical ontologies and structured databases to answer complex diagnostic 
and pharmacological queries with interpretable logical justifications \cite{Erdem2011}. 
In the clinical domain, ASP is especially effective for encoding medical rules and patient-specific data, 
enabling precise and explainable decision-making.

Two common strategies illustrate the role of ASP in medical reasoning. 
The first is \textit{rule-based representation}, where medical knowledge is expressed as logical statements 
that capture relationships among symptoms, diseases, treatments, and patient data. 
For instance, a rule might specify that if a patient exhibits certain symptoms, 
this supports or excludes the presence of particular diseases. 
The second is \textit{knowledge base construction}, where facts, rules, and constraints 
are combined into structured repositories that consistently model diagnostic criteria, 
symptom–disease associations, and therapeutic protocols in an extensible way. 
Together, these approaches demonstrate how ASP provides a flexible yet rigorous framework 
for supporting medical diagnosis, offering not only accurate predictions 
but also transparent reasoning paths that can be trusted in high-stakes settings.\\

\paragraph{\textbf{Integrating LLMs with ASP}}

More recent work explores the synergy between LLMs and ASP 
for enhanced diagnostic reasoning. 
These hybrid approaches aim to combine the language understanding of LLMs 
with the precision and explainability of symbolic reasoning. 
A YAML-based interface has been proposed to guide LLMs 
in extracting structured facts from natural language, 
which are then processed by ASP for logical inference \cite{alviano2024llm2asp}. 
Other work uses ASP to validate and trace misleading or inconsistent outputs 
from LLMs in medical contexts \cite{Nguyen2025}. 
A specialized lightweight LLM has also been trained to generate valid ASP code, 
improving the automation of rule-based medical reasoning \cite{coppolillo2024llasp}.
Collectively, these systems assist in building reliable and clear reasoning pipelines 
for disease diagnosis by combining language understanding with rule-based validation.

\section{Methodology} \label{sec:methodology}

\paragraph{\textbf{Architecture}}

\Cref{fig:architecture} illustrates the \sys architecture, 
which transforms unstructured medical text into a structured knowledge base \cite{ré2014feature}. 
The process begins with the collection of medical literature relevant to the diseases or conditions of interest. 
A carefully designed prompt is then used to guide an LLM in translating this literature into ASP code, 
which is incorporated into a growing knowledge base. 
This knowledge base is further enriched with patient-specific information such as symptoms and examination results. 
An ASP solver subsequently reasons over the combined knowledge base and produces a diagnosis
--or a set of candidate diagnoses--in the form of answer sets.

\begin{figure}[t]

    \caption{\textbf{\sys overview.} The diagnostic process begins by transforming medical literature 
    into an ASP program using a LLM. 
    An ASP solver then executes the program and produces a final diagnosis 
    based on each patient’s data.}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{\textbf{Prompt Construction}}
While large language models exhibit strong instruction-following capabilities, 
their reliability in high-stakes domains remains limited \cite{bowman2023things}. 
To improve robustness, a wide range of prompting strategies have been developed 
and refined over the past several years \cite{liu2021pretrain, promptingguidePromptEngineering}. 
In \sys, carefully designed prompts are employed to guide the model in translating medical literature 
into ASP code suitable for execution by a solver (\cref{fig:bad-prompt}, \cref{fig:good-prompt}).

\caption{An effective prompt that produces accurate and well-structured output.
	The LLM output is structured into multiple rules that aid explainability and can result in partial diagnoses.}
\label{fig:good-prompt}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{\textbf{Logical Program Construction}}

The knowledge base is initialized with a set of symptoms and medical indicators represented as:
\begin{align}
    symptom(s). & \; s \in \{ \text{cough, chest pain, rash}, \dots \} \\
    indicator(i). & \; i \in \{ \text{low MCV, high TIBC}, \dots \}
\end{align}

A patient exhibiting a specific symptom or testing positive for a particular indicator is represented as:
\begin{equation}
    has(x). \; x \in S \cup I
\end{equation}

Logical rules used for inferring diagnoses follow this general form:
\begin{align}
    diagnosis(d_1) & \longleftarrow has(x_1) \land has(x_2) \land \dots \\
    diagnosis(d_1) & \longleftarrow has(x_1) \land has(x_3) \land \dots \\
    diagnosis(d_2) & \longleftarrow has(x_3) \land has(x_4) \land \dots
\end{align}

Correlations between certain symptoms are also encoded in the knowledge base. 
For example, clinical observations have reported links between skin conditions and headaches \cite{migraine-hives}. 
In some cases, the presence of one symptom may lead to the appearance of another. 
Such relationships are captured using rules of the form:
\begin{align}
    has(symptom(S2)) \longleftarrow has(symptom(S1)) \land linked\_symptom(S1, S2).
\end{align}

Example entries for such relationships include:
\begin{align}
    linked\_symptom(grunting, chest\_retractions).\\
    linked\_symptom(nasal\_flaring, chest\_retractions).
\end{align}

Since patients may not exhibit \textit{all} known symptoms, 
\sys must support reasoning under partial information. 
To allow flexible reasoning, a choice rule introduces possible symptoms 
into the knowledge base when patient data is incomplete:
\begin{equation}
    \{ add(symptom(S)) : symptom(S) \}.
\end{equation}

To ensure that the solver identifies at least one diagnosis, 
the following integrity constraint is imposed:
\begin{equation}
    \bot \longleftarrow \sim diagnosis(\_)
\end{equation}

Finally, the solver minimizes assumptions by penalizing added symptoms, 
favoring diagnoses based on known patient information:
\begin{equation}
    \#minimize \{ 1, S : add(S) \}
\end{equation}

This formulation guarantees that at least one diagnosis is produced, 
relying as much as possible on available clinical data rather than hypothetical assumptions.
\\

\paragraph{\textbf{Diagnostic Explainability}}

Symbolic Artifical Intelligence offers a significant advantage 
over subsymbolic methods in terms of explainability. 
In symbolic systems, the relationships between facts and conclusions are explicitly defined, 
enabling transparent reasoning. However, ASP solvers such as \textit{Clingo} do not, 
at the time of writing,\footnote{At the time of writing this paper.} 
provide intuitive traces of their reasoning processes. 
Prior work has explored methods for associating logical propositions 
with their justifications \cite{cabalar2014causal}. For example, 
the logic program shown below is accompanied by a causal graph 
in \cref{fig:causal-g}, which illustrates the connections 
between rules and their inferred outcomes. 
This structure supports the interpretability of conclusions derived by a symbolic logic solver.

\end{figure}
    

The tool \textit{xclingo}~\cite{Cabalar_2020} 
enables the visualization of justifications for results produced by the \textit{Clingo} solver. 
It does so by incorporating a \src{trace} that corresponds to the rules of the logic program. 
Providing clear explanations of how the framework reaches specific conclusions helps users identify 
potential errors in the construction of the knowledge base and offers transparency for the final outcome. 

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

Evaluation was conducted using publicly available patient data.\footnote{\url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset?select=dataset.csv}}
Each patient's list of symptoms serves as input.  
The knowledge base—comprising ASP rules automatically derived  
from medical literature—infers potential diagnoses.  
A prediction is considered correct when the disease inferred  
by the ASP solver matches the actual diagnosis listed in the dataset.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Accuracy of the framework on selected diseases. 
    The size column indicates the number of logical terms in the disease-specific ASP program.}
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
    \toprule
    Diseases & Size & Accuracy \\
    \midrule
    Chicken Pox    &  66  & 95\% \\
    Pneumonia      &  75  & 100\% \\
    Common Cold    &  44  & 100\% \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

High accuracy is achieved when the knowledge base includes a sufficiently 
rich set of logical rules. The size of this base, measured as the number 
of ASP terms associated with a disease, correlates with prediction performance.

In addition to accurate predictions, \sys offers explainability 
through integration with \src{xclingo}. 
This tool visualizes the reasoning process behind each diagnosis, 
revealing the logical path from symptoms to conclusion.

\Cref{lst:chickenpox-explanation} shows an excerpt from the explanation 
tree generated for a patient diagnosed with \textit{chickenpox}. 
The tree visualizes the reasoning steps performed by the ASP solver to reach this conclusion. 
At the root, \sys infers \texttt{diagnosis(chickenpox)} 
based on the presence of multiple symptoms such as \texttt{itching}, \texttt{fatigue}, \texttt{lethargy}, 
and \texttt{high\_fever}. 
Each symptom is further justified through observed inputs or inferred relationships. 
For example, \texttt{lethargy} is supported by repeated instances of \texttt{fatigue} 
and the known association \texttt{linked\_symptom(fatigue, lethargy)}. 
Similarly, \texttt{high\_fever} is explained via the intermediate symptom \texttt{mild\_fever}, 
which itself is supported by \texttt{loss\_of\_appetite}. 
These explanations demonstrate how \sys combines direct observations 
and transitive symptom relationships encoded in the knowledge base to 
construct a transparent and explainable diagnostic path.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presents \sys, a framework for disease prediction using LLMs and ASP. 
The system uses LLMs to extract knowledge from medical texts and translate it into ASP rules, 
which then drive predictions and provide interpretable explanations. 
The architecture, prompt design, and rule structuring in the knowledge base are described.
Experiments show that \sys can predict diseases accurately 
while keeping the reasoning process transparent.

Future work will focus on grounding ASP rules in reliable sources 
through retrieval-augmented generation, fine-tuning LLMs for clinical reasoning, 
and scaling the framework to cover a wider range of diseases.
